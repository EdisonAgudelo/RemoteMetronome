# Remote Metronome

### Why this proyects exists?

I was looking for any tools that make me allowed to just play and configure a metronome
in an audio mixer. Normally a DAW in a PC is used for this purpose, but in my particular case, the PC was far o no easily accessed from the place I was playing/practicing or whatever the reason I required a metronome. This made the process of setting metro parameter really tedious, even frustrating. 

I did not find any free tool that covered my needs (Just to play a metronome in a PC and control it remotely). So I just tried to do so and this is the result.


# Usage
You may want to run the app from code. The hole project was developed and tested with python 3.11.6 on a Windows machine. Older version of python may work. Also, there isn't any known dependency on Window, so this should work in other OS like Linux and MacOS (no tested). Just make sure to install the project requirements.

~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

> A python virtual environment is suggested. Check venv module

There is also a [release](/releases/) folder where you may find “compiled” binaries, and run the app without any previous requirement.

## Tool configuration

![app gui](/doc/app_view.png)

- H sound: Path to a WAV file with the desired sound for the first beat of a bar
- L sound: Path to a WAV file with the desired sound for all other beat in the bar
- Index: WEB view template for remote control.
- Interface: Audio interface, where metronome will output its sound
- Channel: Desired output channel


> Index refers to all HTML files available on [templates folder](/back/templates/). So any user may develop their control web views as their like

> If H sound or L sound are left empty. A default WAV file will be played instead.

## Metronome control
A web server will run on port 2000 with remote control webview. So when you open [localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000) in any browser, you should see something like this

![app gui](/doc/web_view.png)

if you set up your OS Firewall to allow connections on port tcp:2000 from devices in the same net, you should be able to open this web view on other device (e.g a smartphone) to control the sound generated by the metronome running in the PC. To do so you need to know the PC ip and add ":2000" to it in the browser. For example http://192.168.1.23:2000
